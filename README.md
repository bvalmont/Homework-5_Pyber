# Pyber-The Power of Plots
The purpose of this project is to act as a data driven leader of a company in the ride-sharing business. The records for the company include all actvive drivers, historic rides, and details such as city, driver count, individual fares, and city types.

## The first objective is to build a buble plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:
  * Average Fare ($) Per City
  * Total Number of Rides Per City
  * Total Number of Drivers Per City
  * City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
